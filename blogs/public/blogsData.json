    "description": "In the world of data space, the era of Big Data emerged when organizations are dealing with petabytes and exabytes of data. It became very tough for industries for the storage of data until 2010. Now when the popular frameworks like Hadoop and others solved the problem of storage, the focus is on processing the data. And here Data Science plays a big role. Nowadays the growth of data science has been increased in various ways and so on should be ready for the future by learning what data science is and how can we add value to it. <br> What is Data Science? So now the very first question arises is, “What is Data Science?” <br>Data science means different things for different people, but at its gist, data science is using data to answer questions. This definition is a moderately broad definition, and that’s because one must say data science is a moderately broad field!",

It contains every single record of each transaction. Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency an example of the blockchain. Blockchain Technology first came to light when a person or group of individuals name ‘Satoshi Nakamoto’ published a white paper on “BitCoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system” in 2008. Blockchain Technology Records Transaction in Digital Ledger which is distributed over the Network thus making it incorruptible.

The software is written in the Swift programming language or Objective-C and then deployed to the App Store for users to download. If you’re a mobile app developer, you might have had reservations about iOS development. For example, each developer needs a Mac computer—and Macs are more expensive than their Windows-based counterparts. In addition, once you complete your app, it faces a stringent quality review process before it can be distributed through the App Store.",
