    "description": "The intelligence displayed by machines is known as artificial intelligence. Autonomously operating cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, natural-language understanding, etc. are some of the modern machine capabilities which are generally classified as AI. There are three types of artificial intelligence systems- humanized, human-inspired, and analytical artificial intelligence. The long-term goal of artificial intelligence is to develop general intelligence. A few of the other goals are planning, learning, reasoning and perception. Artificial intelligence finds its applications in many fields such as software engineering, operations research and computer science along with healthcare, economics and video games. This book unfolds the innovative aspects of artificial intelligence which will be crucial for the progress of this field in the future. Some of the diverse topics covered in this book address the varied branches that fall under this category. It will serve as a valuable source of reference for graduate and postgraduate students.",
